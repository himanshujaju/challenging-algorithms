This is my attempt at trying out the challenging algorithms listed down in [Austin's blog](https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingalgorithms.html). I am learning python in detail, so this could be the best kind of challenge!

## List of algorithms here
- [ ] Topological sort
- [ ] Recursive descent parsing
- [ ] Myers string difference
- [ ] Bloom filter
- [ ] Piece table
- [ ] Splay tree
